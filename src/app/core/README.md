This directory basically covers the 'model'. Nothing in here should rely on or refer to a component or a service. Contents are basically split between:

- interfaces, defining the shape of particular data types
- data files enumerating instances of particular objects (zones, skills, etc.), basically as json
- some utility factory functions and wrappers
