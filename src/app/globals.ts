    2) More significantly, our XP formulas will exponentially increase the
        ratio between SP gained per action and SP required per sLevel as sLevel
        increases. (Both increase exponentially, but the latter has a bigger base)
        So - until HA and other perks come in - this number will only be close

    (e.g. I want to train at the Tournament, but my riding skill isn't high
    enough. Previously: either gotta train riding in the Stables, or take the
    Tournament slowdown hit. With "level assist": I can decide I don't want
    to pre-game in the Stables because my farming apt sucks, or the gains aren't
    high enough, and decide instead to go train other skills for a while until
    the Tournament turns green).

    TODO: 1/5 might be a bit too high. Basically want this to be high enough
    that it makes it worthwhile to plan around, defering zones to later. But not
    so high that it makes adventuring in zones tuned slightly above the player level
    prohibitive. High values may over-encourage generalization (given that it's
    already sort of encouraged by the way XP formulas scale)
