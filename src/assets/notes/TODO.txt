Marking 'alpha-blockers' with +

MISC/TRIAGE
===
- in the interest of including lots of classes, maybe you should 'copy-paste' some perks/req'ts (and make it easy to do so with the class hierarchy). For example, something similar (/identical) to 'Frugivore', but for a different skill? You're already kind of doing this with e.g. horseman and gladiator.
- I think the buff constructor stuff was actually unnecessary? should probably walk it back? Bleh
- show ancestry buff calculations in stats page
+- add a 'retreat' button next to 'Stop' that ends the current action (giving no benefits) and starts a new one. I don't think it's a bad behavior to enable.
- Restore character name thing? Maybe just prompt for a name at the very beginning and use that throughout?
- add ability to specify post-action text in ActionData
- stats screen: huge turnips pulled, tournaments won, bat kings slain, etc.

BALANCE
=======
- extra perks (other classes) as fn of max lvl with current class (or even just current lvl). Maybe one extra perk at level 100, then 200, etc.
- bonus gains for zones that train multiple skills (right now I think this happens for individual *actions* that train multiple skills, but not across zones)
- Seems like ancestry bonus is basically just a linear multiplier on your progress speed throughout your lifetime. It follows that...
    - if we want high level zones to only be tractable with a high ancestry bonus (and/or more advanced classes), then lower level zones will be blazingly fast when those conditions are met. Is this a problem? Maybe not.
    - what if ancestry bonus was an aptitude multiplier *per player level*?
    - Another option: make the slowdown curve kind of S-shaped.
- the Bat King is great. You should do more stuff like that in lower level zones.
- balancing zone difficulty: kind of want to hit a sweet spot where some zones are too hard when first unlocked, but most zones are sort of boringly easy around the time you're about to unlock the next batch.
- would be interesting to review expected SP gains for each zone. I suspect that zones with bonus actions may have a big advantage (and that high bonus levels might exert a disproportionate influence, despite their low frequency)
- consider rescaling to 10 skill levels per plvl? Removes some incentive to micro-manage skill bars, and skill ups become twice as frequent. Meaning if you're adventuring in a slowdown zone, you get to see more frequent small decreases in the slowdown %.
- add 1 or 2 more superzones with level reqs way out there (and consider pushing back hinterlands too). With the intention that you'll only really be able to reach them by going over leveled-up versions of previous zones.
- tavern and colloseum are kind of duplicative

TECHNICAL
=========
- consider flipping noImplicityAny toggle in tsconfig
- figure out how to write better/more parsimonious CSS. Does angular offer less-like stuff?
- switch to attributive components?
+?- profile the thing
- should think about trying to reconcile passives and buffs (so that it's easy to make one out of the other)
- complete migration to RC5
    - http://angularjs.blogspot.ca/2016/08/angular-2-rc5-ngmodules-lazy-loading.html
    - https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html
- ahead of time compilation
    - also keep seeing this thing about enableProdMode(). Should look into that.
- consider propagating 'bonus'-ness up. Might be interesting to show it in the UI, and to have it interact with some perks.
- redo systemjs.config.js to match the new version in the angular2 quickstart
- from profiling, it seems like jquery is getting called somewhere? how'd that happened? Dependency of the notifications/modals library?
- it would really help testing if there was a quick way to change some of the stuff in GLOBALS (cheatMode and autoSave, primarily), without a recompile/refresh. Maybe in the debug view (problematic since its visibility is now conditioned on cheatMode), or in the console.

MECHANICS
=========
- maybe leveling up a zone should unlock the 'oneshot' actions in that zone?
- item drops
- bonus zones

BUGS
====
+- have seen at least one instance where an action got 'stuck' (but was able to finish it by clicking). That's a little scary. I have a fear that my code is crawling with race conditions.
- title text not showing up when hovering on buffed skill level
- Can scum by refreshing to reset cooldowns. Bleh. Anyone who does this gets the punishment of tedium that they deserve.
    - also, since there's no explicit save button, and autosave is only every 30s, this doesn't work out all that well
- can you meditate more than once during a really long action and pump up the multiplier? I should check. Though if someone does that, I'd kind of be tempted to just congratulate them on their cleverness.
    - yeah, looks like this is definitely possible. only scales additively though, and given gated access to high level zones, I'm inclined to leave this in as a sort of easter egg.
- 'a encyclopedia'
- not that it matters that much, but peasant doubling should probably apply to HA-buffed aptitudes, not base. 
*- locked zones aren't actually
    - also, you can level zones indefinitely and put your ziTokens in the negatives. Same issue - button class disabled doesn't prevent clicking.
*- start an action, go to Stats/Classes, go back home. Some of the time, the action bar doesn't show up, though the action is still running. If you wait for it to complete, a new action will spontaneously appear.
- report from redditor: can kill bat king multiple times per lifetime?
- white skill symbols not visible on yellow ('challenging') background


IDEAS
======
- more immediate benefits/sense of progression associated with leveling up?
- actual prestiging
- associate a color with each skill?
- class homages to other games (hack, FFT, disgaea)
- 'second-tier' classes (with branching options, like Wesnoth, Fire Emblem, etc.)
- add some 'dud' actions - ones with very low difficulty/SP-gains compared to others in the zone
- ability to specify actions that only appear at some minimum zone level.
- could borrow some thematic flavour from the actual ToH concept (a "staffing agency" for heroes)
    - what if characters were randomly assigned really mundane white names? e.g. "Karen the level 5 Shaman", "Donald the level 10 Skeleton".
- might actually be interesting to exercise the ability to change action duration on a per-zone basis. Though this could be confusing (construed as slowdown). Maybe if there are any 'final boss' zones, they should have this - and it should be exaggerated.
    - ooh, apply this to bonus actions! Still feels like they're not 'epic' enough. But slowdown is so touchy, it can't really be relied on to make a bonus action slower (without being so ridiculously slow that it makes the zone impenetrable).

UI
==
- make checkbox in classes component bootstrappy
- the colors for skill difficulty (in zone summary) and apts (class view) are fugly. We can do better.
    - maybe the green skill icons should just be the default color
- forward/back arrows in the classes view 'porthole'
    - ooh, and keyboard navigation
- would also be nice to have keyboard shortcuts for spells
+?- distinguish in the UI between a permanently buffed stat and a temp buffed one (light green vs. dark green?)
- add a nice CSS transition to progress bar when clicked
- zone difficulty UI should probably incorporate cleric perk
    - buffedstatcomponent
- klass component: make icons in grid clickable
    - done, but they should also have clickable cursors
- color action bars by inexp. penalty?
- icons for perks?
- ticker. Where to put it, what to say in it. Current thinking: modal alerts for significant one-time-ish events? And a small scrolling action log in the focal zone view for more spammy stuff?
- unit animations
- three label colors for buffs. One for HA, one for all other passives, and one for temporary buffs.
- A good argument for refactoring the current "last outcome" display into some kind of scrolling ticker: I like the idea of a spell that just gives you some random SP. But it seems important to show the player somewhere how many SP they got in which skills. Where would that be currently? Doesn't make sense to tie to action completion. I'm sure there are going to be other cases like this.
- +1 animation for player level. Better yet: a different animation from skill level. What if the old level just sort of fell to the side and down? That could be kinda funny.
- Across the board, need to work on number formatting. May end up with some super-duper-big numbers eventually - should have a way of dealing with that using scientific notation or whatever. Also, should probably do that classic incremental game thing of giving the option of abbreviations, scientific notation, or whatever else.
- Look into restyling the skill view in the player component.
    - takes up too much vertical space
    - numbers aren't vertically aligned
    - aptitude numbers not nicely aligned, and won't transition gracefully to large values.
    - consider scrunching like the apt view in class component?
- could be nice to replace use of title text (e.g. for showing elaborations on zone difficulty) with something more 'modern' (and mobile friendly?)
- the fact that actions can complete without the action bar reaching the finish line (because of clicks) is kind of irritating.

USABILITY
=========
- for 'on/off' perks, consider indicating in the UI whether they're currently active?
    - and/or: can perks be made more visible in the lastOutcome UI? use buffedstat component for SP gains that are increased by perks? right now perks maybe don't *feel* as impactful as they should.
- the 'go' buttons in the zone summary view are kinda dumb. Maybe the zone name should just be a link.
- give toasts on superzone unlock? (at least the first time)
- ability to sort the skill pane by level/apt/progress would be quite nice. Would help determine which skills are underleveled, for example.
    - not clear whether it should be a one-time reordering, or if skills should continually shift to maintain the sort as they get trained/buffed. The latter could be confusing, and sounds harder to implement, and more risky from a perf pov.
- indicate in the UI which zone you are in ('You are here') and which zone you're adventuring in. It's easy to forget the latter.
    - maybe even show a miniature action bar in the summary pane if you're not currently there? that'd be siiiiiiick
- could be nice to show unlock criteria for unlocked classes (for cases where you come back to the game to find that you unlocked class X, but you don't really know how you did it)
- maybe don't show aptitudes for locked classes?
